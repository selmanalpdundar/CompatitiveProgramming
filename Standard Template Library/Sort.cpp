     Sorting is one of the most basic functions applied to data. It means arranging the data in a particular fashion,
     which can be increasing or decreasing. There is a builtin function in C++ STL by the name of sort().
     Internally this function is implemented as Quick-sort. The complexity of it is O(N*log(N)).
     The prototype for sort is :
