    /* Problem
     *
     * There is a programing contest named SnakeUp, 2n people want to compete for it.
     * In order to attend this contest, people need to form teams of exactly two people.
     * You are given the strength of each possible combination of two people. All the values of the strengths are distinct.
     * Every contestant hopes that he can find a teammate so that their team’s strength is as high as possible.
     * That is, a contestant will form a team with highest strength possible by choosing a teammate from ones who are willing to be a teammate with him/her.
     * More formally, two people A and B may form a team if each of them is the best possible teammate (among the contestants that remain unpaired) for the other one.
     * Can you determine who will be each person’s teammate?
